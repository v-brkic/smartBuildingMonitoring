# **Smart building monitoring**

In this project, a web application for predictive monitoring of advanced buildings was developed, aiming to optimize the energy balance through the use of renewable energy sources.  

By installing photovoltaic panels on the roofs of residential buildings, it enables the monitoring and analysis of solar energy distribution.  

The application collects data on the production and consumption of energy from the panels, storing it in a **PostgreSQL** database, and visualizes it through a web interface built with the **Native framework**.  

The displayed graphical and statistical data include:  
- Historical trends of energy consumption by different devices in the building  
- Total production, storage, and consumption of energy over a selected period  
- Future external weather conditions  

Additionally, the application provides **predictive analytics** using multiple linear regression to analyze and estimate future variables with the aim of optimizing the sale of surplus energy produced.
